/*
Substring with Concatenation of All Words - Feb 24 '12 - 3026 / 11185
You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.
Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once
and without any intervening characters.

For example, given:
S: "barfoothefoobarman"
L: ["foo", "bar"]

You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).
